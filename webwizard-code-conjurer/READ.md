# 🧩 WebWizard: Code Conjurer

WebWizard: Code Conjurer is an AI-powered tool built using **AWS PartyRock**.
The app generates ready-to-use HTML and CSS components from a simple prompt, allowing users to quickly create buttons, cards, layouts, sections, and other frontend elements without writing code manually.
It highlights how generative AI can support rapid UI development, making it easier to prototype ideas, learn component structure, or enhance small web projects.
